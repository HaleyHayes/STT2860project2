### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from their [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page, which also contains variable definitions.

### Create Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Use your code from Project 1 and/or draw from the Project 1 solutions to assemble a dataset below that meets the following criteria. Use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}

data_main <- galtonfamiliesmain %>% 
  transmute(familyid = as.numeric(replace(FamilyID,
                                          FamilyID == "136A", 205)),
            num_children = Children,
            father_ht = Father,
            mother_ht = Mother * 1.08,
            midparent = (father_ht + mother_ht)/2,
            child_sex = tolower(Child),
            child_ht = ifelse(child_sex == "son",
                              Height, Height*1.08)
            )

data_sub <- galtonfamiliessub %>% 
  transmute(familyid = FamilyID,
            num_children = Children,
            father_ht = FatherR + 60,
            mother_ht = (MotherR + 60) * 1.08,
            midparent = (father_ht + mother_ht)/2,
            child_sex = tolower(Child),
            child_ht = ifelse(child_sex == "son",
                              HeightR + 60,
                              (HeightR + 60)*1.08)
            )

data_full <- data_main %>% 
  bind_rows(data_sub)

data_full_ordered <- data_full %>% 
  arrange(familyid, desc(child_sex), desc(child_ht))

data.table(data_full_ordered)

```

#### Dataset #2

Select the variables `familyid` and `num_children` and reduce the dataset so that it contains only one row per family. Again, use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

```{r assembledata2}
reduced_data <- data_full_ordered %>% 
  select(familyid, num_children) %>% 
  distinct()
glimpse(reduced_data)
```

### Part 1: Parent/Child Heights

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Updated Scatterplot #1

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original. Make your dots larger than the default and adjust transparency (`alpha`) to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points. 

Also include the following.

* use `color` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two informative colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use `theme_linedraw()` to add some additional plot formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot1}
ggplot(data_full_ordered, aes(x = child_ht,
                              y = midparent,
                              color = child_sex)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple", "black")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(59:85)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(64:76)) +
  labs(title = "Galton Parents Height over their Childrens Height",
       x = "Childrens Height in Inches", 
       y = "Parents Average Height in Inches") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme()

```

#### Updated Scatterplot #2

Remove the color coding for sons versus daughters from your plot, as well as any other coding related to it. Instead, choose n single color for the points and adjust both `size` and transparency (`alpha`) as needed to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points. Reset the `aes` so child height is the `x` variable and midparent height is the `y` variable. Add a fitted *straight* line to the plot. Update your `labs` accordingly.

```{r updatedscatterplot2, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(data_full_ordered, aes(x = child_ht, y = midparent)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(59:85)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(64:76)) +
  labs(title = "Galton Average Parent Height over their Children",
       x = "Childrens Height in Inches", 
       y = "Average Parents Height in Inches") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme()

ggplot(data_full_ordered, aes(y = child_ht, x = midparent)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(64:76)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(59:85)) +
  labs(title = "Height of Children over Parents", 
       x = "Average Parents Height in Inches", 
       y = "Childrens Height in Inches") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme()

```

### Part 2: Number of Children

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.

```{r childrenbarplot}
ggplot(reduced_data, aes(x = num_children)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Count of Galton Family Children", 
       x = "Count of Children in Family", 
       y = "Count of Families") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0:16)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Do you think that your scatterplots are an improvement over Galton's original diagram? Are there any modifications and/or additions you would make to enhance the clarity or usefulness of your plots?

**ANSWER**

I do believe that the scatter plots are an "improvement" over Galton's original diagram...at least from an inexperienced Data Scientist's mindset.  I found Galton's diagram to be too busy, especially with how many different sets of numbers are on the graph.  I think that once you understood his diagram, it gave a lot more information; however, if I needed to use this within a presentation or show it to someone not in the "know", the scatter plot does a better job.
I might also add faceting to these graphs to compare the slope of the three variables: Parents, Sons, Daughters.  

**Question 2:** Explain the rationale behind the choices you made when creating your scatter plots and bar plot, such as size, color, transparency, or other features. What motivated your decisions? 

**ANSWER**

I first looked at the scatter plot without any aesthetics changed and decided to use the jitter function.  After this, I played around with colors and realized that black and something darker seemed easy to read.  I adjusted size next, but found that I probably wouldn't have changed it if it wasn't required.  I think that going too large was definitely a concern.  The transparency was a trial and error method, until I liked what I saw.  I used the method = "lm" within the geom_smooth() function after we discussed that it was not "straight".  For the bar plot, I have liked the sky blue bar plots and I like the well defined edges being colored in.

**Question 3:** Considering best practices, how does using `coord_fixed()` enhance the authenticity of the information shown in the scatter plots, such as the relationship and spread of the data?

**ANSWER**

The coord_fixed() function retains the visually consistent data from the x & y axis.  If you do not choose to include it, the graph scales things to "fit" the screen better, however it gives you a noticeably different slope that can make you think that there is more or less of a correlation between the data.  The resizing can also make you perceive that the data is more or less grouped or spread than it really is.
